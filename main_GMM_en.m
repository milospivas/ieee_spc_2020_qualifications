% Defining the problem
% 5 normal and 5 abnormal recordings are given as ROS .bag files.
% 
% The task is to implement models which will give a prediction wheter each sample 
% in the recording is normal/abnormal based on measurements from .bag files.
% 
% Visualization:
% Images were extracted from "/pylon_camera_node/image_raw" topic, rotated 180 
% degrees and saved as video files with 4fps framerate.
% 
% From extracted videos we see that the recordings come from some UAV, where 
% the normal recordings were made during stable flight without fast movement while 
% abnormal recordings were made during very unstable flight with sudden movements.
% 
% % Preanalysis
% Every recording has around hundred mesurements but we don't have class labels.
% 
% => We can't use classic classification.
% 
% => Possible solution: Gaussian Mixture Model
% 
% % Measurement analysis
% Based on extracted videos, the following measurements were chosen as relevant 
% for analysis:
% 
% "/mavros/global_position/local"
% 
% "/mavros/imu/data"
% 
% "/mavros/imu/mag"
% 
% "/mavros/global_position/compass_hdg"
% 
% Time plots and histograms show that the oscillations of some measurements 
% are much larger on abnormal recordings than normal ones.
% 
% That means that the derivatives of those signals reach higher absolute values 
% on abnormal recordings, which means that variances of those measurements are 
% larger than on normal recordings so they are deemed as more informative.
% 
% Physical quantities that satisfy the above description are orientation, linear 
% velocity, magnetic field and compass heading.
% 
% Their derivatives are angular velocity, linear acceleration (already available 
% from IMU), and derivatives of magnetic field and compass heading (which can 
% be calculated from measurements), labeled as:
% 
% "IMUAngularVelocity", "IMULinearAcceleration", "MagneticFieldDerivative", 
% "compassHdgDerivative".
% 
% First three quantities are 3D, the fourth one is scalar, so the feature vectore 
% is 10D.
